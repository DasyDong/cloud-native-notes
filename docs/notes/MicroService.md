## Daya, S. et al. (2015). “Microservices from Theory to Practice.” IBM Redbook (SG24-8275-00).

https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/sg248275.html

Ch. 1, sections 1.1,1.3, 1.4.

**Summary**: The first chapter of this Redbook is entitled “Motivation for microservices”, and covers the basics of what they are, the benefits and the pitfalls of using them, and shows how microservices differ from SOA – a topic that is not covered in this course, but which is good background information. You can download the entire Redbook for free, and this is a reference that we shall use throughout the course.

Ch1. Section 1.2

**Summary**: The authors talk about microservices from the perspective of the developer, the tester, the business owner, and service management. In particular, they place emphasis on small teams and communication between team members.

## Jones, T (2017). “So You’re Thinking of Decomposing Your Monolith into Microservices.”

https://blog.codeship.com/so-youre-thinking-of-decomposing-your-monolith-into-microservices/#disqus_thread

**Summary**: A great little article that sums up what microservices are, and some of the problems involved with decomposing monoliths. Very well written!

## Richardson, C (2014). “Microservices: Decomposing Applications for Deployability and Scalability.”

https://www.infoq.com/articles/microservices-intro

**Summary**: This article goes into depth on the pros and cons of decomposition. The numerous diagrams are very helpful to understanding the big picture.

## Gehani, N (2017). “Want to develop great microservices? Reorganize your team.”

https://techbeacon.com/want-develop-great-microservices-reorganize-your-team

**Summary**: The article talks about organizing teams around the “build and run” principle of small teams responsible for the entire life cycle. The author links this to Conway’s Law, which we shall discuss in module 3, lesson 2.

## Barabas, J (2017). “An IBM perspective: IaaS vs. PaaS vs. SaaS.”

https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/iaas-paas-saas

**Summary**: An elegant summary of the differences between these service models.

## Wikipedia: Articles on the service models.

https://en.wikipedia.org

Search on Iaas (this is a short article), PaaS, and SaaS

**Summary**: The IaaS article is brief, but PaaS and SaaS are well-covered, with sections on history, characteristics, challenges, and more.

## Azraq, A. et al. (2017) “Essentials of Application Development on IBM Cloud.”

https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/sg248374.html?Open

Ch. 1, sections 1.7 – 1.11.

**Summary**: This is a ‘presentation guide’ which provides a clear diagram on each page, together with succinct written notes.

## Fowler, M (2016). “Microservices.” Video recording of his presentation at the YOW! Conference in 2016.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irlw-LGIJO4

**Summary**: Martin Fowler has given this talk many times, and you will find several versions of it on YouTube.

## Fowler, M.; Lewis, J. (2014). “Microservices: a definition of this new architectural term.”

https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html

**Summary**: This brief article is a condensed version of the video talk in the previous reference. You may find it very useful to read through after watching the video, as it gives a valuable synopsis of the points he makes.

## Hay, D (2016). “4 Important Microservice Characteristics.”

https://homeadvisor.tech/4-important-microservice-characteristics/

**Summary**: The characteristics discussed are single responsibility, share nothing, private implementation, and private data. A great list! This short article reinforces the points made in the video.

## Montesi, F.; Weber, J. (2016). “Circuit Breakers, Discovery, and API Gateways in Microservices.”

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05830v2

You can download a PDF from the link on the right of the article page.

**Summary**: The circuit breaker is described in great detail. Service discovery and the API gateway are discussed in the next lessons.The circuit breaker was discussed in lesson 4 as part of communications. The API gateway is a part of this lesson, and service discovery is discussed in the next.

## Torre, C. de la; Jones, M. (2017). “Communication in a microservice architecture.”

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/architect-microservice-container-applications/communication-in-microservice-architecture

**Summary**: You can download the article in PDF format.

## Richardson, C. (2015). “Building Microservices: Using an API Gateway.”

https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-using-an-api-gateway/

**Summary**: This page gives numerous examples, which are backed up with illustrations. This is a very useful article to reinforce the concepts presented in the video.

## Peyrott, Sebastián (2015). “An Introduction to Microservices, Part 3: The Service Registry.”

https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-microservices-part-3-the-service-registry/

**Summary**: A nice article that provides clear diagrams to explain key points. As an added bonus there are code examples in node.js.

## Huston, T (2017). “What is Microservices Architecture?”

https://smartbear.com/learn/api-design/what-are-microservices/

**Summary**: This article looks at why you should not write monoliths, and it answers the question from the point of view of microservices. While that is not the optic of this course – monoliths are necessary, after all – the article is well written and makes a strong case for microservices.

## Kumar, M. (2016). “Microservices Architecture: What, When, and How.”

https://dzone.com/articles/microservices-architecture-what-when-how

**Summary**: An overview article. What I like about it in particular is that it examines the problems of microservices architecture (‘Bad Parts’).

## Tikov, S (2015). “Don’t start with a monolith”.

https://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-start-monolith.html

**Summary**: A great article that takes a very different route than the others, and advocates starting immediately with microservices if that is the way you are going, not monolithic decomposition.

## Benjamin W (2014). “Microservices -- Not a free lunch!”.

http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html
